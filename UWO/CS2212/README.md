# Team 1: Weather App

Our team has developed a weather app coded in Java that allows the user to view weather information for searched locations. The user is able to view short and long-term forecasts, have a list of their locations, and modify the user interface to their own preference. The current stage in development can be seen [here](https://github.com/UWO-2212-W2015/team1/wiki/Stage-3).The application connects to the [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data and parses it using the [JSON Library](http://www.json.org/java/).
