					<h4>You’re all familiar with the Lance Armstrong story. Now its time to learn about The Jack Burke Story. 
</h4>
                                        
					<p class="eget"> 
                        
                        For as long as Burke can remember, he’s been riding his bikes in Toronto, Ontario. 
                        
                        <br><br>
                    
                    Now… Skip to 2013 when Jack’s cycling career took a drastic turn for the worst. 
                        
                        <br><br>

The incident occurred in July 2013 when Jack was riding in one of the biggest races of his life. Following the fourth stage of the Tour de l’Abitibi, Burke was wearing the leaders jersey, which meant he was subject to a drug test. When he had heard the news that the race committee wanted him to pee in a cup, he was ecstatic. Never having done this before, he knew this was where his career was going to take off to new heights. Once they make you pee in a cup, you know you’re on track to becoming the professional athlete you’ve always dreamed of.
<br><br>
Little did he know, that one urine sample he was so excited about; changed his life.
<br><br>
The day he thought he would never forget became the day he wishes could be erased from his memory forever.
<br><br>
Upon finishing fourth overall in Quebec at the Tour de l’Abitibi, Burke headed home to Toronto pleased with his results. His best finish in such an esteemed race. 
<br><br>
Thinking that ‘the sky’s the limit’ for his cycling career, Burke received a startling email from the Union Cycliste Internationale. The email explained that the urine test he had given months ago in Quebec had come back positive. 
<br><br>
Burke said, “My initial reaction was that I was confused, scared and terrified knowing what this meant. I was home alone and read the email on my phone and had to put it down on my desk to continue reading because my hands were shaking I was so scared.”
<br><br>
This was the day his life truly changed. 
<br><br>
Jack tested positive for a substance called hydrochlorothiazide. As a rider, you’re exposed to doping day in and day out and have well-rounded knowledge of performance enhancing drugs; but this one, Burke said he didn't even know what it was. HCTZ, as it is commonly referred to as, is a diuretic, meaning it is used to treat high blood pressure and fluid retention. 
<br><br>
Although not a steroid, or even a direct performance-enhancing drug, HCTZ is banned by the Union Cycliste Internationale because it produces extreme and hurried weight lost, as well, can mask the use of other drugs by intensifying the volume of urine produced. And most crucial in the case of cycling, HCTZ, through dilution, can make it harder to distinguish and recognize other, more performance-enhancing banned substances. 
<br><br>
Jack’s urine sample showed an HCTZ concentration of 0.8 ng/mL, which, for those of you who don't know, is less than one billionth of a gram…
<br><br>
Even with an amount so minuscule, the World Anti-Doping Code assumes the defendant guilty and that their innocence must be proven through a court of law. 
<br><br>
This was when Dion Burke, Jack’s father leapt into action, researching day and night, devoting his life to relieving his son of the charges held against him. Dion rounded up everything he could find that Jack had used on the day of the incident, threw it in a plastic bag and drove 6-hours to Montreal in the hopes that the World Anti-Doping Agency lab could run tests. 
<br><br>
Only to find out the World Anti-Doping Agency couldn't test anything for him because they were opposing sides in the case, he drove home. 
<br><br>
Taking on a second job as an investigator, Dion’s goal was to find evidence supporting his son’s innocence. Tirelessly working, following every lead he could, and questioning everybody he could get his hands on, Dion finally find something.
<br><br>
He developed ‘the water theory’.
<br><br>
The water theory goes as follows: Dion retraced the steps of exactly what Jack did that day, down to the minute. He found that Jack did something no other athlete did that day. He filled his five water bottles up in the town of Malartic where the race was held instead of in Rouyn-Noranda where the athletes slept the night before. 
<br><br>
After extensive research on the drinking water in Malartic, Dion had the evidence he had been looking for for months. Upon finding the perfect lawyer for Jack’s case, James Bunting, they were ready for trial. 
<br><br>
With the trial date scheduled abnormally early, it left little time for consultation. In the hopes that the verdict came back in favour of Jack, he needed time to travel to Italy for the junior time trials on September 24th, 2013. 
<br><br>
After six and a half hours of listening too lawyers and toxicologists decide his fate, Jack slowly exited the room and travelled home to pack for Italy – hoping he would here the verdict before getting on the plane with his teammates. 
<br><br>
Standing in the check-in line, Jack got the call. Scrambling to find it, he saw his lawyer’s name on the screen. 
<br><br>
“We won,” Bunting reluctantly told Jack. 
<br><br>
Why are we talking about a junior cyclist caught on doping charges? Because as he says, “as far as I know I’m the only athlete in the history of sport to bare no guilt for a positive test.”
<br><br>
“I’ve been found entirely innocent by the highest courts in the world for all of sport. Twice.” As painful as it is to go through it once, Jack had to endure it twice. 
<br><br>
“As cheesy and lame as it sounds, ‘It ain’t about how hard you hit, it’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.’” 
<br><br>
“That was something I repeated to myself probably 100 times a day, over and over again. That was something I Found comforting”
<br><br>
“No matter how much I’m hurting in training, how bad of a race I’m having or anything else that’s gone off in my life, I’ve never and I don’t think I ever will suffer even close to how I did then.”
