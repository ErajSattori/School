                        Jackie Robinson (1919 – 1972) revolutionized the game of baseball—on and off the field. Most people today grew up in a world where it was simply normal to look out on the field, the court, or even the classroom and see other minorities, racially or otherwise, participating; it was not always like this. It was April 15th, 1947—a day in which everything changed. Jackie Robinson appeared in his first game for the Brooklyn Dodgers, becoming the first black man to play in Major League Baseball; thus breaking the colour-barrier that existed in professional baseball prior to his debut.  Sportswriter Ben Estes describes the MLB at the time as “by far the biggest and most culturally important sport at the time in the U.S.”(Estes 2014). The former MLB World Series champion’s courage and bravery during a time when “[blacks] were still denied basic civil rights in the U.S.” cleared the way for his peers and other future players to be able to do the same (Estes 2014). However, Robinson’s impact on the game and society is sometimes overlooked. In order to measure the magnitude of Jackie Robinson’s impact, this paper will examine race demographics in baseball since Robinson’s debut, symbolic gestures in baseball, and commemorations in society that all demonstrate Robinson’s significance. <br><br>
	Notable race demographics in baseball since Jackie Robinson’s MLB debut must first be examined in order to attain a sense of the magnitude of Robinson’s impact. As noted above, prior to Robinson’s debut, there were no coloured baseball players; the league was predominantly white. According to a study conducted by the Society for American Baseball Research, by the end of the 1947 season—the year Robinson made his debut—98.3% of players in the entire league were white. Twenty years later, in 1967, 75.6% of players were white—an astounding 22.7% decrease. The latest portion of this study was conducted in 2012 and it concluded that only 63.9% of players were white, which means the remaining 36.1% of players were of a different ethnicity, mainly African-American and Latino: two ethnicities that were hindered by the colour-barrier prior to Jackie Robinson (Armour and Levitt 2012). The trend is undeniable; that being said, one may still argue that this trend is a result of the “changing times”. What many people seem to overlook however, is that Jackie Robinson is not a product of the “changing times”; rather Jackie Robinson is the stimulant that changed the times. He started the trend, and for that reason, these statistics are absolutely reflective of his impact.<br><br>
	Next, symbolic gestures in baseball that demonstrate the impact that Jackie Robinson made will be noted to provide a better sense of Robinson’s legacy. There was no greater honour in baseball than having one’s number retired by their respective team—until Jackie Robinson. On April 15th, 1997 Jackie Robinson’s iconic number ‘42’ was retired throughout the MLB under the direction of MLB Commissioner Bud Selig to commemorate his contributions to the game of baseball. (Bodley 2013). Although he was a good baseball player, this honour had little to do with the six-time All-Star’s performance on the field and more so to do with the barriers he broke off the field. Robinson became the only player, in any sport, to have their number retired by the entire league. The only other player, in any sport, to have their number retired by the entire league since Robinson is the legendary Wayne Gretzky, whose number ‘99’ was retired by the NHL upon his retirement from the game.  This meant that no player coming into the MLB would be allowed to Robinson’s iconic number ‘42’. The only exception comes every April 15th, the anniversary of Robinson’s debut, the date the MLB decided to call “Jackie Robinson Day”. The aforementioned Bud Selig states in reference to “Jackie Robinson Day”, “With all Major League players, coaches and umpires wearing Jackie's No. 42, we hope to demonstrate the magnitude of his impact on the game of baseball. Major League Baseball will never forget the contributions that Jackie made both on and off the field” (Bloom 2014). The league itself pushes boundaries to honour “the contributions that Jackie made both on and off the field” in order to stress the significance and magnitude of Jackie Robinson’s impact—an impact that can be sometimes overlooked.<br><br>
In order to measure the magnitude of Jackie Robinson’s impact outside the game, commemorations in society that represent his significance will be identified. It is an illustrious honour, a rare privilege to have a statue of one’s self in any part of the world; it signifies that person has left an enormous impact. For the most part, people tend to be commemorated with statues in their hometown. Jackie Robinson has been honoured with seven different statues throughout North America—from Montreal, Quebec to Daytona Beach, Florida—to commemorate his impact (Brown 2015). Notably, the statues of Jackie Robinson “[neglect] a visual connection with baseball in the design and interpretive material, Robinson’s statuary marginalises the relationship between his ability as a sportsman and his wider social impact,” (Stride, Thomas, and Smith 2014). In other words, unlike most statues of sports figures, the statues of Jackie Robinson depict images of Robinson off the field: this suggests just how big of an impact Robinson had on society. In addition to the statues, a movie based on the life of Jackie Robinson has also been made to commemorate Robinson’s bravery when he broke the colour barrier in Major League Baseball. Director Brian Helgeland’s film 42 depicts “the powerful story of Jackie Robinson, the legendary baseball player who broke Major League Baseball’s colour barrier when he joined the roster of the Brooklyn Dodgers” (Warner Bros. 2013). Warner Bros. states that together, Robinson and Brooklyn Dodgers General Manager Branch Rickey, the MLB executive that first signed Robinson, “helped changed the game and the nation.” To have seven statues and a movie written after Robinson’s life, signifies that he made an enormous impact not only on baseball, but on society as well. 
The impact Jackie Robinson had on his sport and on society is enormous. Sometimes—and everyone can be guilty for this—people take things for granted and forget just how big of an impact certain people have had on society. Jackie Robinson is one of those people; but, as in this paper, by identifying trends in race demographics since Robinson’s debut, symbolic gestures in baseball towards Robinson, and commemorations in society for Robinson, a sense of the magnitude of Robinson’s impact is more attainable.  It is important to remember and honour the heroes that make impacts like Jackie Robinson: He changed the world in 1947, breaking the colour barrier that existed far too long in Major League Baseball. World renowned film director, producer, writer, and actor Spike Lee said it best: “The country is divided into two periods: before Jackie and after Jackie.”
