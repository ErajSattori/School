					<h4>Mental health is defined as the state of well-being where an individual can recognize their own abilities and deal with normal everyday stressors.</h4>

                        This term is often confused with mental illness, which is different on many levels. Mental illness is a medical illness that results in an impairment of the individual’s cognitive, affective or relational abilities. <br><br>

“If only we had known” is often the quote expressed after the loss of a loved one. Depression is a mental illness that often goes unnoticed by others and has severe consequences.  In the past ten years, depression has been on the rise in young adults and will continue to rise unless light can be shed on this dark disease. Depression is a disorder that effects an individual’s mood regulation resulting in constant extreme lows. These extreme lows may lead to suicide without warning as many are frightened to open up about their disorder. According to statistics Canada, over 200 youth take their life each year as a result of mental health issues, therefore, it is important raise awareness and remove the stigma around this disease. You may just save a life. (Chapman, 2008). <br><br>

At the age of just 14, Daron Richardson, a young girl who loved hockey, died by suicide. For family and friends, this was the last thing they saw coming and they struggled to understand how such a happy young girl could get to such a dark place without anyone knowing. This tragedy sparked an important conversation around mental health. Friends and family started doing things in her memory such as putting purple hearts on their helmets, which spread beyond her hometown in Ottawa. Her father, the former Ottawa Senators assistant coach, and her mother decided they weren’t going to let other families and friends feel they way they did on that cold November day so started a campaign in their daughters memory called Do It For Daron. This campaign was started in hopes to raise awareness and support for those who are afraid or have been struggling to speak out.  They feel strongly that parents need to speak with their children about the emotions they may be feeling and that it’s okay to talk about these feelings. Her father speaks on these feelings  “If we had the chance, we would be having that conversation, it is easy for us to say that now, but hopefully other people will see that it is way too precious not to – way too precious.” <br><br>

Having a positive outlook on mental illness is something that needs to be spread. Many individuals in the hockey community and other sports struggle with mental health issues and choose not to speak out on them. Whether you feel it will benefit yourself or others, speaking out only has positive effects and through this campaign awareness will continue to spread. Remember, we don’t have to lose someone before we can help make a change. <br><br>
