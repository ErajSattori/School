					<h4>The Story of John Scott—the Misfit All-Star 
</h4>
                                        
					<p class="eget"> 
                        
                    I like to think that we all have dreams—becoming the next Prime Minister, winning the lottery, winning the World Series—we all have fantasies in life we wish would become a reality. For John Scott, his dream was to attend and play in the 2016 NHL All-Star Game in Nashville, Tennessee—a prestigious honour any current hockey player would cherish. However, John Scott was not just any current hockey player. For those of you who do not know, John Scott is a professional hockey player best known for his ability to fight and intimidate opponents; his sole purpose is to protect his teammates and create havoc. In other words, John Scott was not a “skilled” hockey player and was widely considered to be one of the worst players in the entire league; the only reason he was in the league was for his enormous six-foot eight stature that towers over opposing players. There was no way John Scott, the enormous misfit, could ever be considered for the All-Star Game—to play and compete against the best players in the world like Sidney Crosby and Alexander Ovechkin—right?
	In attempt to revive fan interest at the NHL All-Star Game in 2016, the League decided to implement fan voting which granted fans the opportunity to vote for which current NHL players they would like to see start the game in Nashville. What could go wrong, right? I mean, why not give society a loaded gun, point it at directly at the League, and expect them not to fire it? ‘In a totally unexpected turn of events’, the fans decided to actually pull the trigger and take advantage of the power granted to them, voting for the biggest misfit in the entire league: John Scott. Before you knew it, John Scott emerged into the top 30 vote-getters, and his story was beginning to garner serious attention as mainstream media outlets, such as TSN and CBC, began reporting about this spectacle; this was a legitimate story and it was gaining legitimate traction. However, all John Scott could recount about this moment, in his article in the Player’s Tribune, was how his teammate told him one night, out of the blue: <br><br>
“Dude you’re 30th in All-Star fan vote,” Scott’s teammate says to him. “They’ll never let you play, John. They’re never going to let you be there. Not a guy like you.” <br><br>
“A guy like me,” Scott writes. “You probably think you know me. Or at least the stereotype of John Scott. Well, let me tell you something that might surprise you: I never wanted to be a fighter. Growing up I always made sure I had the Sherwood TP-70 stick.” <br><br>
Growing up, John Scott always made sure he had the same stick as the legendary skilled defenceman Ray Borque. John Scott was every six year old that has ever laced up a pair of skates; he wanted to be a good hockey player, not a good hockey fighter. He was never the best hockey player however, as he was cut by every junior B team—let alone junior A—he ever tried out for. They always told him the same thing: he was too big, too slow. At a point like this, most would attempt a different profession, maybe something more applicable to their skills; maybe John Scott, the six-foot eight giant, would be a great volleyball player, or basketball player, or maybe even a great engineer. But as I mentioned earlier, John Scott was not just any ordinary person. Instead, Scott decided to work his ass off, get faster, and earn a full scholarship to play hockey and to study engineering at Michigan Tech University. That’s right—hockey enforcer John Scott can process a lot more than just fighting—he has a degree in engineering from Michigan Tech University; how many NHL hockey players, let alone NHL fighters, can say that? <br><br>
As John Scott watched his name soar up the fan voting charts for the NHL All-Star Game, he remembered. He remembered the ten hour bus rides to road games while playing in college:<br><br>
“Driving down single-lane roads in rural Minnesota, snow flying around everywhere, heater broken—and all the business majors watching movies and goofing around,” Scott recounts. “And I’m sitting there propping my engineering book up on my knees, taking a thermodynamics test while these knuckleheads are watching Billy Madison.” <br><br>
It wasn’t an easy journey for John Scott but he remembers making it. He remembers graduating from Michigan Tech University with an engineering degree, completely content with sitting at a cubicle at GM for the rest of his life. The last thought on his mind was, some day… you’re going to be an NHL All-Star. But then, Scott received a phone call that would change his life:<br><br>
“Hey babe,” he remembers telling his wife. “I got an offer to play in the American Hockey League (AHL), in Houston.” <br><br>
Why would a minor-league professional AHL team want some hockey player that has been cut from almost every team he has tried out for? Well, it wasn’t for Scott’s ability with the puck that’s for sure—No, the AHL team wanted John Scott for his ginormous stature. They wanted him to be a big goon and cause havoc with his fists. But here’s something you may not know about Scott: at the age of 23, the time he received this offer, he had never been in a real hockey fight. Sure, he wrestled around in juniors with cages on, but it wasn’t the same; this was the real deal. <br><br>
Scott wanted to be realistic at this point: there were not many fighters, especially new ones, which fought their way up through the American Hockey League into the NHL. So, he made a promise to his fiancé: Three years. Scott had three years to make it to the NHL or he would go back to the real world, utilize his engineering degree, and create a stable home for his wife and soon to be twin daughters. 
As I’m sure you have guessed by now John Scott did catch that break, but it didn’t come without a test of his patience. Thanks to his enormous frame, and God-given ability to fight, Scott, in his third AHL year (the final year Scott had to make the NHL), finally managed to crack the line-up of the Minnesota Wild against the talented Detroit Red Wings.<br><br>
“Against the Detroit Red Wings, of all teams,” Scott recounts. “I hopped over the boards for my first shift and I’m out against Pavel Datsyuk and Nick Lindstrom.” <br><br>
Scott was out on the ice against two of the best players to ever play the game—a surreal moment for someone who was playing college hockey just four years prior. But Scott will take it, he was on the ice, playing in the NHL. And you know what? Scott hung in there. He hung in there and ended up sticking around the league, travelling around North America utilizing his fists and intimidating presence to make a living. 285 NHL games played and 81 fights later, Scott found himself fighting his way to become the leading vote getter in the All-star fan vote. That’s right; John Scott cemented himself a position in the 2016 NHL All-star game. There was only one decision left to be made: would John Scott accept his invitation and attend the game?<br><br>
There was a lot of pressure throughout the league on Scott to turn down the invitation. It was clear an internet troll rewarded Scott with this opportunity; the thought was Scott should decline his invitation and avoid tainting the reputation of the All-star game. The League surely felt this way. I mean, why would the League want their legendary game spoiled by an untalented enforcer who clearly doesn’t belong? Don’t be fooled, however, the League made their stance known. John Scott recounts the League echoing their position when it became evident that Scott was going to win the fan vote: <br><br>
“They didn’t necessarily say ‘This is not the game for you, John’—but I understood it all the same. Honestly, on some level, I agreed.”
Scott did not necessarily entirely see it that way, however. But when the league asked Scott to make a statement to the fans, he did so without hesitation:<br><br>
“Listen, I don’t deserve this. Vote for my teammates,” he told the fans. “And I was telling the truth,” Scott adds. “One of the reasons I’ve made it as long as I have in the league is because I specifically know I’m not an All-star.”
Yet, Scott proceeded to win the All-star fan vote. It was a real movement, and Scott honestly felt humbled by the support he received from the fans—even though it may have been in a comedic fashion. So, when the league approached Scott again to decline the invitation, he thought about it long and hard. The fans wanted to see him there, they voted for him… why not give the people what they want? That being said Scott was residing to declining the invitation and complying with the league’s request, but then they called him—a phone call Scott remembers fairly well:<br><br>
“’Do you think this is something your kids would be proud of?’ That was it, right there. That was the moment they lost me. Because, while I may not deserve to be an NHL All-star, I know I deserve to be the judge of what my kids will – and won’t – be proud of me for.”
That was it right there. That was the moment John Scott officially decided accept his invitation and attend the 2016 NHL All-star game in Nashville, Tennessee, much to the chagrin of the NHL. The fans had won: they won the opportunity to watch Scott compete alongside the best players in the world.  <br><br>
It was never about the game however. This was a story about a guy with a dream. A story about a guy who decided to fight through adversity and accomplish his goal—something we can all find commendable today. And for those of you wondering how Scott fared in the0 All-star game, he was given the loudest ovation of the night—louder than the hometown players of Nashville—scored two goals, and was named MVP of the 2016 All-star game. To add the cherry on top, Scott was named First Star of the week by the League for his contributions to one of the most memorable weekends in NHL history.  <br><br>
